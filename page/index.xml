The reason? I decided to challenge myself again &amp;ndash; this time by diving into a completely alien field: computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the ground up, I learned everything from electrical circuitry and transistor-level CPU design to data structures, algorithms, and computer vision. Somewhere along that journey, I also started building robots during the COVID years &amp;ndash; it eventually took me across the world to the United States, where we won championships every year from 2022 to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are great but I feel like I have more breath than depth, nor did I figure out my life direction. So I continued with a Master’s in Computer Science and took on a cybersecurity scholarship. That period pulled me deep into the rabbit hole of Linux systems and embodied AI. Now, one and a half years into my masters, I have gotten a clearer sense of what I want pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I didn’t know what I wanted &amp;ndash; only that I refused to fall behind in the Age of Digitalisation. I kept pushing, learning, and experimenting. I seem to have an endless curiosirty that constantly pushes me forward. That wind of curiosity has been the wind in my sails through this turbulant era, and I aim to become the best captain of my own life.&lt;/p&gt;
